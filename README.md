This project aims at making websites easier to manage. We at DSC BVP Pune noticed that many students or professionals either don't have a website or face difficulty maintaining one. We came up with a solution to make it accesssible for everyone to be able to manage and build a website with the help of a mobile app. The template used has been referrenced by [@dewanshrawat15's](https://github.com/dewanshrawat15) [dewanshrawat15.github.io](https://github.com/dewanshrawat15/dewanshrawat15.github.io)

## Features
- The Website is built completely using Vue.js, and the data is fetched from Firestore.
- Firestore is a real-time cloud-based database with updates data dynamically.
- This Website can be used as a template by any student or professional.
- Easy to maintain. Does not require any sort of technical experience.
- Firestore provides solutions for storage issues.

## Setting up on Firebase

### Setting security rules on Firestore
Create a Firestore Database, and add the following security rules to the database, to add authentication for only specific people to be able to update details on Firestore:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read;
      allow create, write, update, delete: if request.auth.token.email.matches("personalemailaddress[@]gmail[.]com");
    }
  }
}
```

### Setting security rules on Firebase Storage
Enable the Firebase Storage, and add the following security rules to the database, to add authentication for only specific people to be able to add / update media to the storage bucket:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read;
      allow write, create, delete, update: if request.auth.token.email.matches("personalemailaddress[@]gmail[.]com");
    }
  }
}
```
